ðŸš— Excited to share my Data Science project: *Electric Vehicle Adoption Analysis*!   I explored real EV data using Python to uncover trends in make, model, range, and year.   Used Pandas, Seaborn &amp; Matplotlib for EDA, visualizations &amp; pattern recognition.   Loved this hands-on dive into the EV world!   #Python #EDA #EVAnalysis
